The Sex Pistols were a revolutionary punk band that emerged from London in 1975. With their raw sound and provocative lyrics, they became icons of the punk movement. Their lone studio album, "Never Mind the Bollocks, Here's the Sex Pistols," is still celebrated as a defining moment in the history of punk rock.
